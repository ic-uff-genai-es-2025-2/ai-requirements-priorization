The software described in the sources is the "Enterprise E-mail" project, which aims to establish a statewide electronic mail system. The primary goal is to provide service delivery and support for a statewide e-mail, messaging, and calendaring service. The scope explicitly excludes collaboration services, such as shared documents, workflows, instant messaging, and discussion forums. The system is designed to meet the needs of all executive branch agencies and reduce the current cost of operation and support.
