The RALIC Project, which stands for the Replacement Access, Library and ID Card project, was a large-scale software project executed at University College London (UCL). he fundamental purpose of the project was to enhance UCL's existing access control system by replacing obsolete systems and consolidating the multiple access and identification mechanisms previously in use. Before the project began around 2005, staff, students, and visitors needed to carry various forms of identification—such as swipe cards, photo ID cards, library barcodes, digital security codes, and metal door keys—to access different secure areas like libraries, academic departments, and computer clusters. The main objective of RALIC was to combine several functions into one card, including the photo ID card, access card, and library card. The system was intended to consolidate access to facilities such as the library and the Bloomsbury Fitness Centre, thereby eliminating the need for separate registration processes for UCL ID card holders. The project was classified as large-scale for the evaluation context of the thesis, as it had a complex base involving more than 60 stakeholder groups and approximately 30,000 users. These stakeholders frequently had differing and occasionally conflicting requirements. The project started in 2005 and the system has been deployed at UCL.
